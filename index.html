          <p>making this quick, let's perform a critique.</p>
          <p>often it is asserted, "let's do something!" in response to extractive 
          or capitalistic capture empowered by technology[0][1]. </p>

          <h2>problem</h2>
          <p>here's a problem: https://whoownswhat.justfix.nyc/en/</p>
          <p>they make apps like this, and they _appear_ to be "liberating" data</p>
          <p>and what's it? a massive react app</p>
        </section>

        <section>

          </p>
          <p>so we've seen it all before: ostensibly we appear to be liberating the 
          working class and the colonized when you know it's probably best just to start 
          with a <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite dot com</a> 
          and maybe add some (hypermediated) navigation between a
          <a href="https://schema.org/WebPageElement">WebPageElement</a> and 
          properly apply microdata[2]</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://osds.openlinksw.com/">
              <img src="./assets/images/no-web-ful-microdata.png" alt="screenshot of the openlink structured data sniffer for the critiqued patient" />
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>but there again spinoza's question crops up: <em>why does the human fight 
          for their servitude as if it were their freedom?</em></p>
          <p>
            <img src="./assets/images/inaccessible-website.png" alt="screenshot of the the wave.webaim.org tool reporting on the inaccessible critiqued patient; it's got like 15 errors on a page of real interest" />
          </p>
          <p>an inaccessible javascript trap that is visually appealing that 
          gives everyone a sense of apparent empowerment</p>
          <p>and surprise surprise: no microdata vocabulary applied at all. it's a 
          black hole</p>
          <p>so, an inaccessible, <em>undescribed</em> javascript trap that only gives the 
          stark appearance of being a website, which doesn't even work without javascript</p>
          <p>we're shooting the working class in the foot</p>

              <p>in my view, that's a honeypot for a buyout and to repurpose human 
              traffic: perfect for someone who wants to shoot instances of it down 
              as quickly as they're deployed. post hoc, ergo propter hoc. rinse, repeat</p>
              <p>now they get free leads on digital easements and personally 
              identifiable information. because you know that app-like isn't following GDPR</p>
              <p>and none of these apps will be "webbed" without linked data (use 
              of microdata vocabularies like schema.org), so now people won't be 
              able to take advantage of search engines to see how matters are 
              going with others who are running similar instances across 
              territories of the planet.</p>
              <p>let's also mention that the validators, auditing tools, etc. 
              aren't made available through the site; but a "donate" button is</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
            <p>a friend pointed out that it's somewhat unsurprising that such app-likes only allow for payment to one person</p>
            <p>i agree. i don't particularly find anything nefarious going on here. audrey lorde's point primarily is that epistemic
            betrayers are our problem, not the hammers and sickles we pick up. so the main problem here is how a potential liberatory
            tool can be built like a gilded guillotine only to, as the story is as old as time itself, be "bought out" once the 
            movement toward its production is re-organized into production forces: capital's primary desire is slavery, not 
            exploitation. those running this app-like will not be benefitting from the protective nature of a vocabulary and 
            will hardly benefit from search engines. they're not even using the very vocabulary of that search engine which uses 
            javascript to crawl its pages. so conceptual hygiene aside, the app is fundamentally a silo, a black hole, as it were.</p>
            <p>it's very shiny and looks great on the surface, but under the hood, all it can be is decomposed for whatever kernel 
            of insight is leftover after its fall. it's prime pickings for airbnb to buy it out, because it has no conceptual nor 
            architectural integrity. more than this, the critique should serve as an explanation as to why hardly anyone will pick 
            it up to engage in parallel play (taking the risk to host other apps like it). in a way, accessible, free, described 
            web apps (with hypermediated apis) invite people not only to engage in liberating trust in the data, but they enable 
            counter-storytelling as the very lifeforce of the webapp's raison d'&#233;tre</p>
